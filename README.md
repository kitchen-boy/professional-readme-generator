# DESCRIPTION
Let's create a high-quality README for your application or any open source project on GitHub. We'll include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributionsâ€”this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. 

## TASK COMPLETED
Created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

# USER STORY
```md

```

# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

WHEN I enter my email address
